# Symetria Vue Exercise

> A Vue based homework exercise as part of the Symetria interview process

- Notes
    - Vuex for state management
    - Forked webpack-exports-loader (on my github) to fix how it wraps legacy non es6 modules (PR coming soon)

- Things that I intentionally didn't spend a ton of time on
    - CSS. It's really hacked together.
    - Design. Takes more time than I'm able to devote to this. It doesn't break horribly.
    - Error handling. I'm aware.



## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# install dev dependencies
npm install --only-dev

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# build for production and run in webpack-dev-server with compression
npm run prod
```
